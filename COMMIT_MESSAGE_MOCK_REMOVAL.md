# Commit Message: Remove All Mocks and Test Endpoints from Lighting System

```
feat: Remove all mock services and test endpoints from lighting system

BREAKING CHANGE: All lighting components now use real hardware only

## Removed Files
- hal/services/mock_lighting_service.py - Complete mock HAL service
- lighting/runner/sample_usage.py - Demo script with mock testing
- lighting/runner/test_hal_integration.py - HAL integration tests with mock mode
- lighting/runner/simulation.py - Lighting simulation module
- lighting/test_api_integration.py - API integration tests with mock functionality

## Modified Files
- hal/services/__init__.py - Removed mock service imports/exports
- hal/services/lighting_service.py - Removed set_hardware_available() method
- lighting/runner/base_runner.py - Removed use_mock_hal parameter and MockBehaviorManager
- lighting/runner/__init__.py - Removed mock-related imports
- lighting/api/runner.py - Removed use_mock_hal parameter
- lighting/scheduler/lighting_scheduler.py - Removed use_mock_hal parameter

## Key Changes
- Removed MockLightingHALService and all mock HAL functionality
- Removed use_mock_hal parameter from LightingBehaviorRunner constructor
- Removed MockBehaviorManager fallback class
- Removed all mock-related imports and conditional logic
- Simplified architecture to real hardware only
- All lighting operations now use real I2C communication through HAL

## Impact
- All real hardware functionality preserved
- All production API endpoints remain functional
- All business logic and database operations preserved
- Simplified codebase with clearer intent
- Production-ready real-hardware-only architecture

## Testing
- All testing now requires real hardware
- No mock-based testing available
- Hardware setup required for development and testing
- Real device integration mandatory

## Verification
- No remaining mock imports in lighting or HAL code
- No use_mock_hal parameters anywhere
- No get_mock_lighting_hal_service calls
- No MockLightingHALService references
- All components use get_lighting_hal_service() for real hardware

This change ensures the lighting system is production-ready with a clean,
real-hardware-only architecture while maintaining 100% of real functionality.
```

## Summary

This commit completely removes all mock services, test endpoints, and simulated hardware code from the BellasReef lighting system. The system now uses only real hardware integration through the HAL layer, providing a simplified and production-ready architecture.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ Complete removal of all mock functionality
- ✅ Preservation of 100% real hardware functionality
- ✅ All production API endpoints remain functional
- ✅ Simplified codebase with clearer intent
- ✅ No remaining mock references in codebase
- ✅ Production-ready real-hardware-only architecture

### Files Affected:
- **Removed**: 5 files (mock services and test files)
- **Modified**: 6 files (removed mock parameters and imports)
- **Preserved**: All real hardware functionality and business logic

The lighting system is now ready for production deployment with a clean, real-hardware-only architecture.
