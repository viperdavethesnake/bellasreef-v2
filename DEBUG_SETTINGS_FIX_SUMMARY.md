# DEBUG Settings Fix Summary

## Problem
The core service was referencing `settings.DEBUG` and `settings.LOG_LEVEL` in `core/main.py`, but these fields were not defined in the shared settings configuration, which could cause `AttributeError` when the service starts.

## Solution
Added the missing `DEBUG` and `LOG_LEVEL` fields to the shared settings configuration to ensure the core service can start without referencing missing config fields.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Shared Settings Configuration
**File Modified:** `shared/core/config.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `DEBUG: bool = False` field to the Settings model
- Added `LOG_LEVEL: str = "INFO"` field to the Settings model
- Both fields are placed in the Service Configuration section
- Default values ensure the service starts safely in production

#### 2. Updated Core Environment Example
**File Modified:** `core/env.example`

**Changes:**
- Added `DEBUG=false` to the Service Configuration section
- Added `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` to the Service Configuration section
- Provides clear examples for both development and production

## Configuration Details

### DEBUG Field
- **Type:** `bool`
- **Default:** `False` (production-safe)
- **Usage:** Controls uvicorn reload behavior
- **Development:** Set to `true` for auto-reload during development
- **Production:** Should be `false` for security and performance

### LOG_LEVEL Field
- **Type:** `str`
- **Default:** `"INFO"`
- **Usage:** Controls logging verbosity
- **Valid Values:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`
- **Development:** Can be set to `DEBUG` for detailed logging
- **Production:** Should be `INFO` or higher for performance

## Usage Examples

### Development Environment
```bash
# In core/.env
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# In core/.env
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Service Behavior

### With DEBUG=true (Development)
- Uvicorn will auto-reload when code changes
- Useful for development and testing
- May have performance impact

### With DEBUG=false (Production)
- Uvicorn will not auto-reload
- Better performance and security
- Recommended for production deployments

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `shared/core/config.py` | Modified | Added DEBUG and LOG_LEVEL fields to Settings model |
| `core/env.example` | Modified | Added DEBUG and LOG_LEVEL configuration examples |

## Verification

The changes ensure that:
1. ✅ `settings.DEBUG` is available in `core/main.py`
2. ✅ `settings.LOG_LEVEL` is available in `core/main.py`
3. ✅ Service starts without `AttributeError` for missing config fields
4. ✅ Default values are production-safe
5. ✅ Configuration is clearly documented

## Impact on Other Services

**Note:** The other services (control, poller, scheduler) have their own separate settings configurations and already include DEBUG fields in their respective `env.example` files. This change only affects the core service which uses the shared settings.

## Result

✅ **The core service can now start without referencing missing config fields**

The `settings.DEBUG` and `settings.LOG_LEVEL` references in `core/main.py` now work correctly, and the service will start properly in both development and production environments.
